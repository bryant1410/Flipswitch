# Flipswitch

Flipswitch is a library to implement a common infrastructure for On/Off switches. It provides a number of default switches to be used by tweaks such as Activator, Auxo and others, and may be extended through packages that add additional switches.

Public headers are available in the public path, and inside binary packages distributed via Cydia. See http://iphonedevwiki.net/index.php/Flipswitch for documentation.
